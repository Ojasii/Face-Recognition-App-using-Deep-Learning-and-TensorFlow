# Facial Recognition and Detection System using Deep Learning
## 📖 Overview
This project implements a **Facial Recognition and Detection System** using **Deep Learning** techniques in Python.  
The model identifies and verifies human faces from images using convolutional architectures and distance-based feature comparison.

Developed and tested entirely within a Jupyter Notebook, this system demonstrates a complete **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** — from dataset preparation and model training to evaluation and visualization.

## 🧩 How It Works
1. **Face Detection:**  
   Detects and extracts faces from raw images using OpenCV’s Haar Cascades or DNNs.  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Normalizes and resizes face images for uniform input to the model.  

3. **Model Training:**  
   Trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** or **Siamese Network** to learn facial embeddings.  

4. **Face Recognition:**  
   Compares embeddings using Euclidean or cosine similarity to verify identity.  

5. **Evaluation:**  
   Visualizes loss, accuracy, and confusion matrices for interpretability.
